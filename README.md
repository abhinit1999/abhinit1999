I am an AI & Generative AI Engineer passionate about building real-world applications that harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and intelligent automation. My expertise spans React, FastAPI, Streamlit, LangChain, Prompt Engineering, and Vector Databases, enabling me to design, develop, and deploy scalable AI solutions from concept to production.

One of my flagship projects is Prompt2SQL, an AI-powered application that converts plain English into SQL queries using LLMs, LangChain, and Groq. Built with React on the frontend and FastAPI on the backend, integrated with SQLite, and deployed on Vercel and Render, it demonstrates my ability to merge cutting-edge AI with clean, user-friendly interfaces.

I have also developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using LLMs and vector databases to enable intelligent document search and context-aware responses. This system empowers users to query large datasets and receive precise, source-backed answers in real time.

Beyond technical execution, I bring a product mindset, understanding business needs, translating them into AI-driven solutions, and ensuring smooth deployment for end-users. My work includes AI-powered document search, automated data retrieval systems, and workflow-enhancing tools that make complex processes simple and efficient.

I thrive at the intersection of AI innovation and practical software engineering, always exploring how to push the boundaries of what AI can do for real people in real industries.
